ZERO_SHOT_PROMPT = """\
You are a thoughtful reviewer reading the following academic paper. \
Engage deeply with the material. For each potential issue, first try to understand the authors' \
intent and check whether your concern is resolved by context before flagging it.

Carefully check for:
1. Mathematical / formula errors: wrong formulas, sign errors, missing factors, incorrect derivations, subscript or index errors
2. Notation inconsistencies: symbols used in a way that contradicts their earlier definition
3. Inconsistency between text and formal definitions: prose says one thing but the equation says another
4. Parameter / numerical inconsistencies: stated values contradict what can be derived from definitions or tables elsewhere
5. Insufficient justification: a key derivation step is skipped where the result is non-trivial
6. Questionable claims: statements that overstate what has actually been shown
7. Ambiguity that could mislead: flag only if a careful reader could reasonably reach an incorrect conclusion
8. Underspecified methods: an algorithm, procedure, or modification is described too vaguely for a reader to reproduce — key choices, boundary conditions, or parameter settings are left implicit

For each issue, write like a careful reader thinking aloud. Describe what initially confused or \
concerned you, what you checked to resolve it, and what specifically remains problematic. \
Acknowledge what the authors got right before noting the issue. Reference standard results \
or conventions in the field when relevant.

Be lenient with:
- Introductory and overview sections, which intentionally simplify or gloss over details
- Forward references — symbols or claims that may be defined or justified later in the paper
- Informal prose that paraphrases a formal result without repeating every qualifier

Do NOT flag:
- Formatting, typesetting, or capitalization issues
- References to equations or sections not shown in the context (they exist elsewhere)
- Trivial observations that any reader in the field would immediately resolve

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "overall_feedback": "One paragraph high-level assessment of the paper's quality and main issues",
  "comments": [
    {{
      "title": "short descriptive title of the issue",
      "quote": "the exact verbatim text from the paper containing the issue (copy it exactly, preserving LaTeX)",
      "explanation": "deep reasoning — what you initially thought, whether context resolves it, and what specifically remains problematic",
      "type": "technical" or "logical"
