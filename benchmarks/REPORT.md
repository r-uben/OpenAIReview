# Can LLMs Review Academic Papers? Benchmarking Review Approaches

*March 2026*

Academic peer review is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. A single paper can wait months for feedback from a handful of reviewers, each bringing different expertise and attention. Meanwhile, LLMs can read a 50,000-token paper in seconds and have absorbed more scientific literature than any individual human. So the natural question is: how well can they actually catch mistakes?

This post documents a benchmarking experiment: building an AI paper reviewer and iterating on approaches to maximize recall against Refine comments as ground truth.

## The Benchmark

We used four papers from [refine.ink](https://www.refine.ink/examples), each with comments from Refine identifying specific errors. Every comment includes a verbatim quote, a detailed explanation, a confidence score, and a `paragraph_index` that anchors it to a specific location in the document.

| Paper | Field | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| Inference in Molecular Population Genetics | Statistical Genetics | 15 |
| Coset Codes --- Part I | Information Theory | 19 |
| Targeting Interventions in Networks | Economic Theory | 6 |
| Chaotic Balanced State in Cortical Circuits | Neuroscience | 12 |

**52 ground-truth comments total** (43 technical, 9 logical). The papers range from 24K to 50K tokens.

## Evaluation Metrics

We use three complementary recall metrics:

1. **Similarity recall** --- fuzzy string matching (threshold 0.35) between predicted and ground-truth quotes. Strict; penalizes paraphrasing. Largely useless for LaTeX-heavy text.
2. **Location recall** --- a ground-truth comment is "recalled" if any prediction falls within a paragraph window (we report +-3 and +-5). Measures whether the model is looking at the right part of the paper.
3. **LLM-judge recall** --- a Haiku judge determines if a predicted and ground-truth comment (within a location window) refer to the same issue. The primary metric. We report both gated (+-3) and wide-gated (+-10) versions.

## Methods

All methods use Claude Opus 4.5 as the large model and Claude Haiku 4.5 as the small model, via OpenRouter. All share the same deep-check prompt with 8 issue categories, Refine-style writing instructions, and leniency for introductory/overview sections.

### Zero-shot

Sends the entire paper in a single prompt with instructions to find technical and logical mistakes. Cheapest method but limited by single-pass attention.

### RAG Local

Splits the paper into paragraphs (~140 tokens each), uses Haiku to filter candidates (~40 of ~300), then deep-checks each with +-3 paragraph window context (asymmetric: 5 before, 2 after).

### Incremental

Processes the paper sequentially through ~27 merged passages (~8000 chars each), maintaining a running summary of definitions, equations, theorems, and key claims. For each passage:
1. **Deep-check** (Opus): running summary + window context + passage → find errors
2. **Summary update** (Opus): current summary + passage → updated summary
3. **Post-hoc consolidation**: one final Opus call to deduplicate and merge related issues

The running summary is capped at ~2000 tokens and provides the model with notation context from the entire paper seen so far, without requiring the full text.

We report two versions:
- **Incremental**: after consolidation (fewer, higher-quality comments)
- **Incremental (Full)**: pre-consolidation (all comments found, higher recall but lower precision)

## Results

### All methods on all 4 papers

| Method | Comments | Loc Recall | Loc Recall +-5 | LLM Recall | Precision | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zero-shot | 23 | 17.3% | 23.1% | 0.0% | 0.0% | $1.35 |
| RAG Local | 211 | 48.1% | 50.0% | 15.4% | 4.5% | $3.63 |
| **Incremental** | **68** | **53.8%** | **69.2%** | **25.0%** | **19.1%** | **$16.73** |
| Incremental (Full) | 247 | 82.7% | 86.5% | 44.2% | 9.3% | $15.81 |

### Per-paper breakdown (LLM recall)

## Key Findings

### 1. Incremental summaries dramatically improve recall

The incremental method achieves 25% LLM recall (44% pre-consolidation) compared to 15% for RAG Local and 0% for zero-shot. The running summary gives the model access to notation and definitions from the entire paper seen so far, enabling it to catch inconsistencies that span many pages.

### 2. Consolidation trades recall for precision

Post-hoc consolidation reduces comments from 247 to 68 (72% reduction) while only dropping LLM recall from 44% to 25%. Precision improves from 9.3% to 19.1%. The consolidation prompt deduplicates and merges related issues, removing comments that flag standard conventions or the same underlying problem.

### 3. Location recall reveals the true ceiling

The incremental (full) method achieves 83% location recall, meaning the model finds *something* at nearly every ground-truth error location. The gap between 83% location recall and 44% LLM recall is the deep-check quality problem: the model finds issues at the right place but not always the *same* issue as the expert reviewer.

### 4. Zero-shot fails with the uniform prompt

Zero-shot found only 23 comments with 0% LLM recall across all papers. The leniency instructions (designed for the incremental method's per-passage checking) may be too gentle for a single-pass review where the model sees the full paper and has full context.

### 5. Cost scales with depth

| Method | Cost/paper | Comments/paper | Cost/LLM-recalled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zero-shot | $0.34 | 6 | N/A |
| RAG Local | $0.91 | 53 | $0.45 |
| Incremental | $4.18 | 17 | $1.29 |
| Incremental (Full) | $3.95 | 62 | $0.69 |

The incremental method costs ~4.6x more than RAG Local per paper but finds 1.6x more ground-truth issues (consolidated) or 2.9x more (full). The bulk of the cost is the Opus deep-check calls (27 passages x ~8000 tokens each), plus 27 summary update calls.

### 6. Coset-codes remains difficult

All methods struggle with coset-codes (16% LLM recall even for incremental full). This paper has dense information-theoretic notation and geometric arguments that may require deeper domain expertise than the model can provide from general training.

## Evolution of the Approach

### Phase 1: RAG filter experiments

The original RAG pipeline used Haiku to pre-filter paragraphs, selecting ~17% for deep-checking. Analysis showed this was the primary bottleneck: the filter missed many ground-truth error locations. Removing the filter improved coverage but increased cost.

### Phase 2: Definitions prefix

Adding a definitions prefix (keywords: "definition", "denote", "let", "theorem", "assume", plus equation patterns) improved recall on notation-heavy papers. The biggest gain was on targeting-interventions (0% -> 50%) and chaotic-balanced-state (17% -> 42%).

### Phase 3: Incremental approach

Instead of dumping raw definition paragraphs as context, the incremental method maintains a structured running summary updated after each passage. This provides:
- **Structured context**: notation, equations, theorems, assumptions, and claims organized by category
- **Sequential awareness**: the summary reflects only what has been seen so far, matching how a reader encounters the paper
- **Bounded cost**: the summary is capped at ~2000 tokens regardless of paper length

The incremental approach significantly outperforms all RAG variants on recall while producing fewer, higher-quality comments after consolidation.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Incremental for maximum recall.** 44% LLM recall (full) or 25% (consolidated) at ~$4/paper, with 83% location coverage.

2. **Use RAG Local for budget-constrained runs.** 15% LLM recall at $0.91/paper --- 4.6x cheaper.

3. **Always report location recall.** It reveals that models engage with the right parts of papers far more often than LLM-judge recall suggests. The gap between location and LLM recall is the key metric for measuring deep-check quality.

4. **Post-consolidation is a precision/recall tradeoff.** If precision matters, use consolidated results (19% precision). If recall matters, use full results (44% LLM recall).

5. **The zero-shot prompt needs separate tuning.** The leniency instructions designed for per-passage checking hurt single-pass review performance.

## Next Steps

- Tune zero-shot prompt separately (less leniency, since full paper context is available)
- Improve consolidation to preserve more true positives while still deduplicating
- Investigate why coset-codes recall is low across all methods
- Test on a larger set of papers beyond 4 benchmark examples
- Evaluate with different large models (GPT-4o, Gemini) for cost comparison
